Small-scale farmers throughout the world are exposed to variability in the prices they get for their crops. Most farmers typically sell their produce at the spot price in the few weeks after they harvest their crop. This translates into two problems for many farmers: uncertainty of income and selling at a suboptimal price. What added value can small-scale farmers get by selectively picking the time of sale of their crops? Specifically, would the extra-income generated from selling at optimal price outweigh the cost of inventorying these crops?
